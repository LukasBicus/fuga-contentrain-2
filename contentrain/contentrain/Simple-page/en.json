We aspire to become a sought-after place for gaining an overview of the Christian cultural scene in Kosice.\n\nWhy the name \"FUGA\"?\nFUGA is: A contrapuntal musical composition with consistent equality of all voices.\nFUGA is: escape.\nFUGA MUNDI is: a conscious decision for something that has greater meaning and value.\nFUGA is: gap.\n\nThat's why we gave our cultural center such a name :-)",
