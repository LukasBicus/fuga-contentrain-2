# About us
FUGA - Christian Cultural Center is an independent cultural center that aims to support, present, and create art and culture based on traditional Christian moral principles.

Our vision is to be a space where truth, goodness, and beauty meet in art and culture. We aspire to become a sought-after place for gaining an overview of the Christian cultural scene in Kosice.

Why the name "FUGA"?
FUGA is: A contrapuntal musical composition with consistent equality of all voices.
FUGA is: escape.
FUGA MUNDI is: a conscious decision for something that has greater meaning and value.
FUGA is: gap.

That's why we gave our cultural center such a name :-)
